# Algorithms and Inference

Statistics is the science of learning from experience, particularly experience that arrives a little bit at a time. In fact, there are two main statistical theories:

* Bayesianism
* Frequentism
 
 There are *algorithmic* and *inferential* aspects of statistical analysis. For example, *mean* is an algorithm and *standard error* is an inference of the alogorithm's accuracy. Algorithms say what the statistician does while inference says why he or she does it. 

## A Regression Example

For the case of *linear regression*, we infer the accuracy using the standard error. However, a modern computer-based algorithm *lowess* has no such formula. Instead, *bootstrap standard deviation* is used to determine the original curve's accuracy.

## Hypothesis Testing
