## Students: Tweet Your Way to a Job

Nowadays, getting a job out of college is becoming more and more difficult, and the looming education bubble burst adds all the more fear and loathing. However, some experts say social media, which is something that just about everyone uses nowadays, might be the key to landing a great job.

Experts say that it is essential that students use social media to help their career. When companies see potential employees interacting with industry professionals on Twitter and other social media, it shows the company that they’re more likely to understand the company’s values, and thus be more hirable.

Basically, you want to show the company that you’re interested and that you are keeping up with what’s going on in the field. Further, you want to let them know what you’re up to. For example, if you are an art student, you might attend art shows, write a blog about them, and tweet the blog to local artists. Such actions could land you a good job, or at least a great contact.

Blogs can be beneficial for several reasons such as continuous writing practice, an observable portfolio of work, and evidence that you spend your free time thinking seriously about the field. 

Add your CV to show your passion, and don’t forget to share your work via Twitter. Be persistent but not pestering, and listen carefully to what the company says. It might land you the job of your dreams.
