## Students: Tweet Your Way to a Job

Nowadays, getting a job out of college is becoming more and more difficult, and the looming education bubble burst adds all the more fear and loathing. However, some experts say social media, which is something that just about everyone uses nowadays, might be the key to landing a great job.

Experts say that it is essential that students use social media to help their career. When companies see potential employees interacting with industry professionals on Twitter and other social media, it shows the company that they’re more likely to understand the company’s values, and thus be more hirable.

Basically, you want to show the company that you’re interested and that you are keeping up with what’s going on in the field. Further, you want to let them know what you’re up to. For example, if you are an art student, you might attend art shows, write a blog about them, and tweet the blog to local artists. Such actions could land you a good job, or at least a great contact.

Blogs can be beneficial for several reasons such as continuous writing practice, an observable portfolio of work, and evidence that you spend your free time thinking seriously about the field. 

Add your CV to show your passion, and don’t forget to share your work via Twitter. Be persistent but not pestering, and listen carefully to what the company says. It might land you the job of your dreams.

## Technology: Using Power for Good

As high-level technology is becoming increasingly available to common people in ever remote places around the world, there are numerous ways in which the power of technology can be used for social good. Some examples include gathering data and visualizing patterns and trends with mobiles and mapping software; translating big data into useful statistics using predictive analytics; monitoring real-time crises with unmanned aerial vehicles; and mobilizing groups around the world using social media. 

Technology, if used in the right way, can forge alliances with local grassroots movements, predict and possibly deter violence, and drive mass movements to give a voice to those who may elsewise remain voiceless.

Further, technology might allow organizations to focus on large-scale systematic change rather than settling for mere incremental change. 

According to people like Melinda Gates, it’s all about connecting statistics to actual human stories. This is precisely what organizations in India, for example, aim to do when it comes to combatting maternal mortality.

On the other hand, new technologies come with greater responsibilities. For example, volatile regions with vulnerable communities face the danger of information being collected and used in malicious ways. Thus, measures must be taken with such new technologies to provide proper training and protect potential victims.

Regarding concern a while ago about summarizing an article:

here are my tips for you. :) First of all, you have to find the main topic of the article. Then find the supporting points/arguments. Always remember that it's very important that you put the information together IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Do not just read the sentences from the book because that is a big No-No. Okay? I hope I was able to help. If you have other questions, feel free to ask me here in Uphone Talk. Have a nice day ahead!
